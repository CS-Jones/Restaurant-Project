# Restaurant-Project
 
Used this project to play around with google apis - wanted an easier way to find restaurants based on radius around friends location. 


Things to improve -

Limit what sort of restaurants are given back after a search - for example when searching restaurants other food places would return such as take aways/cafes.
Location picked currently you need to know the address you want to search around.
Find certain restaurants you want based on food type - Chinse/Pizza/American etc.
